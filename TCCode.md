# TC String Button - Usage Guide

The TC String button allows you to quickly switch to Krunker's beta servers using TC codes. This guide will walk you through how to use this feature in the PC7 client. 

## Make sure you are on the latest version of PC7!

## What is a TC Code?

A TC code is a special identifier that lets you connect to specific Krunker beta servers. These codes are often used for testing new features or participating in special events.

## How to Use the TC String Button

### Step 1: Find the TC Button

The TC button is located alongside the other navigation buttons at the top of your Krunker client interface. It's labeled simply "TC" and will open a popup when clicked.

### Step 2: Enter Your TC Code

1. Click on the TC button to open the input popup
2. Enter your TC code in the text field (example: `7698321c2c371ff3e7e1afcb84bd180ca8294fc4`)
3. Click the "Join" button or press Enter

The client will automatically redirect you from the regular `https://krunker.io/` to the beta server with your TC code (like `https://beta.krunker.io/?tc=7698321c2c371ff3e7e1afcb84bd180ca8294fc4`).

## Tips for Using TC Codes

- TC codes are case-sensitive, so make sure to copy them exactly as provided
- You can press Escape to close the TC popup without joining a server
- If the TC code is invalid, you'll see a connection banned screen, don't worry this just means you copied it wrong
- You can use the same TC button to switch between different beta servers by entering a new code

## Where to Find TC Codes

TC codes are typically shared by:
- Krunker developers for testing features
- Competition organizers for private matches
- Content creators for special events

Remember that TC codes are usually meant for specific purposes and may not always be publicly available.
